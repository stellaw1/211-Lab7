Abstract: 
We started working on Lab7 on October 29th at Kaiser. We started working at 2:00 PM. 

Development Sequence:
- Stella created a private GitHub repo for writing code
- Stella wrote the adjustments to our code from Lab 6 including fixing Overflow flag and cpu.v. 
-Baknel wrote the module instantiation of the instruction register in cpu.v
-Baknel wrote the cpu.v file connecting the blocks of the RISC in cpu.v
-Stella wrote the instruction decoder in cpu.v
-Stella began writing the FSM controller in cpu.v, our first implementation included just the ADD instruction as a proof of concept
-Baknel expanded the FSM implementation to include the 5 other instructions, and control the outputs to both the datapath module and instruction decoder
-Stella spent considerable time debugging FSM, problems mostly occured in port connections, both names and sizes
-Baknel began writing the test bench for cpu.v in cpu_tb.v to include one basic test of the MOVim MOV and ADD instructions
-Stella added functionality to the test bench creating further tests for other edge cases and possible bugs. Test suite contains 3 tests for every instruction
-Baknel assisted in the debugging of cpu_tb.v before the lab was completed
-Stella succesfully tested the code in ModelSim and compiled it in Quartus to then further test on De1-Soc
-Baknel created a series of tests to use on the De1-Soc to demonstrate the functionality of the code to the TA
